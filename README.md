# Bikesharing Program


## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a visualization for investors to decide if they want to do a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. Using the data gathered from NYC I was able to complete an analysis using Tableau and Pandas to help investors solidify their business proposal.

## Summary 
Completing the analysis displayed to me that further information is needed in order to complete and solidify a proper business proposal.
In order to have a better business proposal the company should consider gathering data on bike upkeep in order to manage repair costs or loss better. Also, another import factor could be demographics or socioeconomic levels in the community that they want to create the bike-sharing program. Success of the program has societal dependants that are important to the business proposal, will people have the time and financial freedom to partake in this program? what communities are surrounding where the program will be initiated in Des Moines?
